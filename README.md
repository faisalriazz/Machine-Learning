#  ML Algorithms 

### All the snippets need to be optimized to be made scalable and are only initial implementations of the standard ML algos

## Dataset Sources

## This Week TODO:
* UNIVARIATE and MULTIVARIATE LINEAR REGRESSION(W/WO GRADIENT DESCENT) -- DONE
* LOGISTIC REGRESSION on first 10 principal components of a dataset to CLASSIFY an Experiemnt as of Physics OR Chemistry -- DONE
* NEURAL NETS for binary geo-coordinates classification using back propogation -- DONE
** The Architecture of the neural net implemented is shown below ,with two hidden layers and two units in each hidden layer, apart from bias term **
![](https://github.com/ishaan007/Machine-Learning/blob/master/Assets/neural_net_implemented.jpg)
* SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES -- 3 dimensional feature set mapped to 180 dimensional feature set where m= #landmarks/#training egs using gaussian kernel
* K-Means Clustering --DONE
* Principal Component Analysis (PCA) --DONE
* Col Filtering --TODO


### README will be updated ** very very frequently
