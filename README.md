## This Week TODO:
* UNIVARIATE and MULTIVARIATE LINEAR REGRESSION(W/WO GRADIENT DESCENT) -- DONE
* LOGISTIC REGRESSION on first 10 principal components of a dataset to CLASSIFY an Experiemnt as of Physics OR Chemistry -- DONE
* NEURAL NETS for binary geo-coordinates classification using back propogation -- DONE
** This is the neural net implemented ,with two hidden layers and two units in each hidden layer, apart from bias term ** 
![](https://github.com/ishaan007/Machine-Learning/blob/master/Assets/neural_net_implemented.jpg)
* SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES -- TODO

### README will be updated ** very very frequently
